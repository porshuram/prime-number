# prime-number
more efficient way to find prime numbers using gained prime number


the list (prime_numbers) will be automatically updated as the programme runs.
the list may exclude 2 to avoid dividing odd numbers by 2.
the list may not include 3 as it is already included in main programme.
for the very first time list should be created manually with at least 5 included at first.
the maximum limit of finding prime numbers is just the square of the last found prime number when it was last run.

<code>python3 prime.py {limit}</code>

pass 0 as limit for maximum limit available
